		<p>More and more of human activity involves digital data.
            Managing the corresponding worldwide demand for
            increased data consumption and faster data processing
            can be helped by both fundamental and applied research on photonic
            systems. Photonic systems are unique because information
            can travel at the speed of light and can be relatively immune
            to environmental noise. Furthermore, individual light particles,
            i.e., photons, can act as an intermediary between
            quantum particles, and so photonic systems may be an
            important component in the
            realization of quantum computers which could dramatically
            speed up certain computational tasks, for example
            factoring the product of two large prime numbers as outlined by
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor's algorithm</a>.
            One direction of research in this area called nanophotonics
            is to take advantage of nanofabrication techniques developed by the
            electronics industry to create novel nano-scale
            photonic structures for guiding and manipulating light.

		<p>I worked in the area of nanophotonics at the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>
            and the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://jqi.umd.edu/">Joint Quantum Institute</a>
            to create novel photonic waveguide systems that can travel
            around corners without significant loss and are robust to
            fabrication imperfections. This will be important in
            the mass production of photonic integrated circuits
            with complicated circuit topologies. We realized this
            new photonic waveguide by
            engineering the topological properties of the photonic crystal
            band structure. Our theoretical results were published in
            <a target="_blank" href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/18/11/113013">New Journal of Physics 18, 113013 (2016)</a>
            and our experimental results were published in
            <a target="_blank" href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6376/666">Science 359, 666 (2018)</a>.

                Left figure is a schematic of the honeycomb-lattice-like
                photonic crystal with triangular air holes in a dielectric
                substrate and right figure is a simulation of the
                electric field intensity of the topological edge state.
                Note the edge state goes around sharp corners without
                decreasing in intensity, indicating that the edge state
                is topologically protected. The mode is excited around a
                wavelength of 940 nm. More details can be found in our paper
