		<h2 style="text-align:center">Physics: Ultracold Atoms</h2>
		<p>When atoms are cooled to very low temperatures, they can
            behave like both particles and waves. Once the wave nature
            becomes strong enough, all the atoms can synchronize with
            each other and turn into a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).
            The video below shows a collection of dilute strontium atoms
            turning into a dense BEC a few micronmeters in size
            in real time over 3 seconds.
            Below the video are pictures of the experimental setup to
            produce these ultracold atoms in the laboratory.

        <p>The realization of Bose-Einstein condensates in dilute
			ultracold atomic gases in 1995 opened a new direction
            in the study of macroscopic quantum phenomena and was
            acknowledged by a
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2001/summary/">Nobel Prize</a>
            in 2001. Many phenomena that were previously only accessible
            in condensed matter such as
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluidity">superfluidity</a>
			in liquid helium and
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity">superconductivity</a>
            in various solid state materials were now open for
            investigation in atomic systems with the tools developed in
            atomic, molecular and optical physics.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Applications of studying such ultracold atoms include gaining
            a better understanding of strongly interacting matter
            which could lead to the engineering of useful new materials,
            developing new methods of sensing and measurments for
            position, timing and navigation, as well as the potential
            realization of quantum computers. Possible new materials
            include those for magnetic data storage and transportation
            through the use of
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spintronics">spintronics</a>,
            where the spin of an electron is used directly to store
            and transport information. Potential new platforms for position,
            timing and navigation include ultra-stable
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock">atomic clocks</a>
            and inertial sensing systems which do not rely
            on the global positioning system.
