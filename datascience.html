		<h2 style="text-align:center" id="Data_Science">Data Science</h2>
		<p>Data science broadly encompasses ideas and techniques,
            including machine learning and deep learning, to
            analyze data in a quantitative and systematic way to
            extract actionable insights.
            Some of my projects in this area can be seen at
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hiromiyake">my GitHub page</a>,
			and below are a few specific projects with links.
            Below that, I list some resources I found helpful in
            learning about the technical aspects and breaking into data science.
            And at the end, I list resources that can help you learn more
            once you are a data scientist.
        </p>

			<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hiromiyake/arxiv-topic-trends">
				Arxiv Topic Trend Analysis</a>
				<br><a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/">Arxiv</a>
                is a preprint server used by many researchers in physics
                to post research papers for general viewing. I explored
                the general trend of a few topics over the years using
                their API with Python.
			</li>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hiromiyake/movie-recommender">
				Movie Recommender with Collaborative Filtering</a>
				<br>I implemented a movie recommendation system based
                on collaborative filtering in Python. The movie rating
                data is taken from the
				<a target="_blank" href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/">MovieLens</a>
                website.
			</li>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hiromiyake/word-prediction">
				Word Prediction</a>
				<br>I developed an ngram model for word prediction in R.
                This was deployed as a
                <a target="_blank" href="https://hiromiyake.shinyapps.io/wordprediction/">Shiny app</a>
                and is written up in an R Jupyter notebook.
			</li>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hiromiyake/Sr-atom-number-variation">
				Strontium Atom Number Variation</a>
				<br>Jupyter notebook looking at the dependence of
                atom number as determined from a CCD camera on a number
                of observables in our ultracold strontium experiment,
                including laboratory temperature and humidity measurements.
			</li>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hiromiyake/PCA-cold-atom-images">
				PCA on Cold Atom Images</a>
				<br>Python files that can be used to subtract unwanted
                fringes on cold atom absorption images taken with
                CCD cameras. This was created to be used with cold atom
                experiments for image analysis, and is based on the
                technique of principal component analysis.

		<h3 style="text-align:center">Learning Resources</h3>
		<p>The topics that are particularly important for a data
            science practitioner are 1) computer science/programming,
            2) probability and statistics, 3) machine learning, and
            4) Structured Query Language (SQL). Below is a list of
            some resources,
            which include Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs),
			websites, and books, I've found particularly useful
            in learning about these topics and preparing for
            data science job interviews. I've personally gone
            through each of the resources and
            believe each of them will be worth your time
            at least for your intellectual enrichment, if not
            to help you do well in your data science job interviews.
            They would be most appropriate for people who have
            some college-level math and computer science experience.
			Many of the resources
            listed below are accessible online for free.
